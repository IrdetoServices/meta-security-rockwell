#This is a bbappend example file, renamed to mprotect-test_0.1.bbappend-test to keep it out of bitbake processing so that mprotect_test executable can confirm that MPROTECT is working.
#If it were renamed to mprotect-test_0.1.bbappend then bitbake would pick it up and then mprotect_test would be able to bypass MPROTECT.

#Users of meta-security-rockwell can likewise add execptions to their binaries that require it by copying this example .bbappend to the correct-named file and modifying the ROCKWELL_ADD_EXCEPTION_${PN} 
#to specify the binary requiring the exception
